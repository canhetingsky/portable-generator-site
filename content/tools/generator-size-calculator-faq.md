This page answers the most common questions about how a **generator size and wattage calculator** works and how to interpret its results.  
If you want to calculate your generator size directly, you can use the calculator here:

## What does a generator size calculator actually calculate?

A generator size calculator estimates the minimum wattage your portable generator must provide to safely power your selected appliances. It adds up the total running watts and then accounts for the single largest starting (surge) wattage, since most appliances do not start at the same time.

---

## Is a generator wattage calculator different from a generator size calculator?

In practice, no. A generator wattage calculator focuses on the electrical load (watts), while a generator size calculator translates that wattage into a practical generator capacity you can purchase. Both tools aim to answer the same question: **How many watts does my generator need?**

---

## Why does the calculator include starting watts?

Many appliances with motors—such as refrigerators, air conditioners, sump pumps, and furnace blowers—require significantly more power for a brief moment when they start. Ignoring starting watts is one of the most common reasons generators overload or shut down unexpectedly.

---

## Why does this calculator add only the largest starting surge?

This calculator assumes realistic usage. Appliances rarely start at the exact same moment. Instead of stacking all starting surges—which would dramatically oversize the generator—we add the largest single surge to the total running load. This produces a more accurate and practical recommendation for portable generator sizing.

## How accurate is this generator size calculator?

This calculator provides a reliable estimate for most home backup and portable generator use cases. However, actual requirements may vary depending on appliance efficiency, age, power factor, and usage patterns. Always check the manufacturer specifications of both your appliances and the generator before making a final purchase decision.

---

## Should I choose a generator larger than the calculated result?

In most cases, choosing the next standard generator size above the calculated result is a smart decision. This provides additional headroom, improves reliability, and allows for future appliance additions without overloading the generator.
