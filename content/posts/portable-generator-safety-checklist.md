## Portable Generator Safety Checklist

Portable generators can be extremely useful during power outages, outdoor activities, and job site work. However, improper use can lead to serious injuries, property damage, or even death.

This safety checklist is designed to help users operate portable generators responsibly by addressing the most common and most dangerous risks associated with generator use.

---

## 1. Generator Placement and Ventilation

Improper placement is one of the leading causes of generator-related accidents.

### Safety guidelines

- Always operate the generator **outdoors**
- Place the generator **at least 20 feet away** from buildings
- Keep the exhaust pointing **away from doors, windows, and vents**
- Never run a generator in a garage, basement, crawl space, or near open windows

Carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless. Even short-term exposure can be fatal, especially in enclosed or poorly ventilated areas.

---

## 2. Carbon Monoxide (CO) Risk Awareness

Carbon monoxide poisoning is the most serious hazard associated with portable generators.

### Key safety points

- Install **battery-powered or hardwired CO detectors** in your home
- Test detectors regularly, especially during outages
- Never assume partial ventilation is safe
- Shut down the generator immediately if a CO alarm sounds

Running a generator indoors or near openings can allow exhaust gases to accumulate rapidly, even if the generator is located outside.

---

## 3. Electrical Load and Overload Prevention

Overloading a generator can damage equipment and create fire hazards.

### Safe load management

- Know your generator’s **running and starting watt limits**
- Start high-wattage appliances **one at a time**
- Avoid connecting unnecessary devices
- Monitor engine sound and performance for signs of overload

If circuit breakers trip or voltage drops occur, reduce the load immediately.

---

## 4. Proper Use of Extension Cords

Incorrect extension cord use is a common source of electrical hazards.

### Best practices

- Use **heavy-duty, outdoor-rated extension cords**
- Ensure cords are rated for the connected load
- Keep cords dry and away from standing water
- Avoid running cords under doors or carpets

Damaged or undersized cords can overheat and increase the risk of fire.

---

## 5. Fuel Handling and Storage Safety

Fuel mishandling is another major cause of generator-related injuries.

### Fuel safety checklist

- Turn off the generator and let it cool before refueling
- Never refuel a hot generator
- Store fuel in approved containers
- Keep fuel away from open flames and heat sources
- Avoid overfilling the fuel tank

Fuel vapors can ignite easily, especially near hot engine components.

---

## 6. Weather and Environmental Considerations

Portable generators are not designed to operate in wet conditions unless specifically protected.

### Weather safety tips

- Never operate a generator in rain or snow without proper coverage
- Use generator tents or canopies designed for ventilation
- Elevate the generator to avoid water pooling
- Do not touch the generator with wet hands

Water exposure increases the risk of electric shock and equipment damage.

---

## 7. Grounding and Electrical Connections

Proper grounding helps reduce electrical hazards.

### Grounding guidelines

- Follow manufacturer instructions regarding grounding
- Use grounding rods if required by the generator design
- Never bypass grounding systems
- Avoid connecting generators directly to home wiring without a transfer switch

Improper backfeeding can endanger utility workers and damage electrical systems.

---

## 8. Safe Startup and Shutdown Procedures

Correct startup and shutdown reduce mechanical stress and safety risks.

### Startup checklist

- Ensure all loads are disconnected before starting
- Start the generator with no appliances connected
- Allow the engine to stabilize before adding load

### Shutdown checklist

- Disconnect all appliances
- Let the generator run briefly to cool down
- Turn off the engine and fuel supply

---

## 9. Children and Pet Safety

Generators should never be accessible to children or pets.

### Safety precautions

- Keep generators out of reach
- Do not allow children to operate or approach the generator
- Prevent pets from contacting hot or moving parts

Hot surfaces and moving components can cause serious injuries.

---

## 10. Maintenance and Inspection

Regular maintenance improves both safety and reliability.

### Maintenance reminders

- Check oil levels before each use
- Inspect air filters and spark plugs
- Look for fuel leaks or loose connections
- Follow the manufacturer’s maintenance schedule

A poorly maintained generator is more likely to fail or operate unsafely.

---

## Common Generator Safety Mistakes

Many accidents occur due to simple oversights.

Common mistakes include:

- Running generators indoors or in garages
- Ignoring CO detector alarms
- Overloading the generator
- Refueling while the engine is hot
- Using damaged extension cords

Avoiding these mistakes significantly reduces risk.

---

## Why Generator Safety Matters

Portable generators involve fuel, electricity, and exhaust gases. Each presents potential hazards when misused.

Following a clear safety checklist helps protect people, property, and equipment while ensuring the generator performs as intended during emergencies or routine use.
