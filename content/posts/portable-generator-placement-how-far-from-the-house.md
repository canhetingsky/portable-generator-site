## Portable Generator Placement: How Far From the House Is Safe?

Correct generator placement is one of the most important safety decisions during a power outage. Even when used outdoors, portable generators can produce dangerous levels of carbon monoxide if placed too close to a home.

This guide explains **how far a portable generator should be placed from a house**, why distance matters, and how to choose a safe location that reduces health and fire risks.

---

## The Short Answer: Minimum Distance Guidelines

Most safety authorities recommend placing portable generators:

- **At least 20 feet (6 meters)** away from the house  
- Away from doors, windows, vents, and crawl spaces  
- With the exhaust directed away from buildings  

This distance applies regardless of generator size or noise level.

---

## Why Distance Matters So Much

Portable generators burn fuel to produce electricity. This process releases exhaust gases, including carbon monoxide (CO).

Carbon monoxide:

- Is invisible and odorless  
- Can build up quickly  
- Can enter homes through small openings  

Even generators operating outdoors can create dangerous conditions if placed too close to living spaces.

---

## How Carbon Monoxide Enters a Home

Carbon monoxide does not behave like smoke.

It can:

- Drift through open windows or doors  
- Be pulled inside by ventilation systems  
- Accumulate near walls or rooflines  
- Travel into basements or attics  

Wind direction and pressure differences can cause exhaust to re-enter a home unexpectedly.

---

## Why “Just Outside” Is Not Safe

Placing a generator:

- On a porch  
- Near a garage door  
- Beneath an open window  

is extremely dangerous.

These locations allow exhaust to concentrate and enter the structure, even if the generator itself is technically outdoors.

---

## Special Risks Near Garages

Garages—especially attached garages—are not safe locations for generators.

Risks include:

- Carbon monoxide buildup  
- Exhaust infiltration into living spaces  
- Residual gas accumulation after shutdown  

Generators should never be operated in garages, even with doors fully open.

---

## Choosing a Safe Generator Location

When selecting a placement spot, consider the following:

- Distance from the house (minimum 20 feet)  
- Exhaust direction  
- Prevailing wind patterns  
- Flat, stable ground  
- Clearance from combustible materials  

A clear, open outdoor area is always preferable.

---

## Generator Placement During Rain or Snow

Weather conditions often lead people to place generators closer to buildings, which increases risk.

Safer alternatives include:

- Using manufacturer-approved generator covers  
- Setting up a canopy designed for outdoor equipment  
- Elevating the generator on a dry surface  

Never compromise distance for weather protection.

---

## Noise vs Safety Trade-Offs

While placing a generator farther away may increase extension cord length or noise concerns, safety must take priority.

Key points:

- Longer cords are safer than closer placement  
- Use outdoor-rated, heavy-duty extension cords  
- Avoid routing cords through doors or windows  

Proper cable management is safer than reducing distance.

---

## Apartment and Shared Building Considerations

In apartments or multi-unit buildings, safe placement may be impossible due to:

- Limited outdoor space  
- Proximity to other units  
- Shared ventilation systems  

In these cases, combustion-based generators are often unsuitable, and indoor-safe power alternatives should be used instead.

---

## Carbon Monoxide Detectors Are Not Optional

CO detectors add an important layer of protection.

Recommendations:

- Install detectors on each level of the home  
- Test before outages  
- Use battery-backed units  

Detectors provide warning but do not replace proper generator placement.

---

## Common Placement Mistakes to Avoid

- Placing generators near windows or doors  
- Operating under eaves or overhangs  
- Using garages or sheds  
- Assuming small generators are safer  

Size does not reduce carbon monoxide risk.

---

## Safe Placement Checklist

Before starting a generator, confirm:

- At least 20 feet from the house  
- Exhaust facing away from buildings  
- Stable and level surface  
- No nearby openings  
- CO detectors active  

These steps significantly reduce risk.

---

## Final Thoughts

Portable generator placement is not just a matter of convenience—it is a critical safety decision. Even outdoor operation can be dangerous if distance guidelines are ignored.

By maintaining adequate separation from the house, managing exhaust direction, and following safety best practices, you can reduce the risk of carbon monoxide exposure and operate your generator more safely during power outages.
