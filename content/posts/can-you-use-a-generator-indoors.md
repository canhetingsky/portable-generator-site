## Can You Use a Generator Indoors?

The short answer is **no**—portable generators should never be used indoors. This includes homes, apartments, garages, basements, sheds, or any enclosed or semi-enclosed space.

Despite this, many accidents occur each year because people underestimate the risks or misunderstand how generators work. This guide explains **why indoor generator use is dangerous**, addresses common misconceptions, and outlines safe alternatives for backup power.

## Why Using a Generator Indoors Is Dangerous

Portable generators produce electricity by burning fuel. This combustion process creates exhaust gases, including **carbon monoxide (CO)**—a colorless, odorless, and highly toxic gas.

When a generator runs indoors, carbon monoxide can quickly build up to lethal levels, even if windows or doors are open.

Key risks include:

- Carbon monoxide poisoning  
- Fire hazards  
- Oxygen displacement  
- Heat buildup  

These dangers can occur within minutes.

---

## Understanding Carbon Monoxide Risk

Carbon monoxide is particularly dangerous because it is difficult to detect without proper equipment.

Important facts:

- CO cannot be seen or smelled  
- Symptoms may begin with headache or dizziness  
- Exposure can lead to unconsciousness or death  

Generators can produce **much higher CO concentrations** than vehicles or household appliances, making indoor use especially hazardous.

---

## Common Myths About Indoor Generator Use

### “I’ll Just Use It in the Garage”

Garages—even with doors open—are not safe.

Carbon monoxide can:

- Accumulate rapidly  
- Travel into living spaces  
- Remain trapped after the generator is turned off  

Attached garages pose an even greater risk due to shared air circulation.

---

### “I’ll Open Windows for Ventilation”

Opening windows or doors does **not** provide sufficient ventilation.

CO disperses unpredictably and can:

- Re-enter the space  
- Build up in adjacent rooms  
- Reach dangerous levels quickly  

Ventilation does not eliminate the risk.

---

### “It’s Only for a Short Time”

Short-term use is still dangerous.

Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur in minutes, not hours. Even brief indoor operation can be fatal under the right conditions.

---

## Are Any Generators Safe to Use Indoors?

### Battery-Based Power Stations

Battery-powered portable power stations—sometimes called *portable solar generators*—do **not** produce exhaust.

These devices are safe for indoor use because:

- They do not burn fuel  
- They emit no carbon monoxide  
- They operate silently  

However, they are limited in power output and runtime and are suitable only for low-wattage devices.

---

### Combustion Generators: Always Outdoors

Any generator that burns:

- Gasoline  
- Propane  
- Diesel  
- Natural gas  

**Must be operated outdoors**, regardless of size or noise level.

---

## Safe Placement for Outdoor Generator Use

When operating a generator outdoors, follow these guidelines:

- Place at least **20 feet** from doors, windows, and vents  
- Direct exhaust away from buildings  
- Operate on a flat, stable surface  
- Protect from rain using approved covers  

These precautions reduce—but do not eliminate—carbon monoxide risk.

---

## Carbon Monoxide Detectors: An Important Backup

CO detectors provide an additional layer of safety.

Recommendations:

- Install detectors near sleeping areas  
- Use battery-powered or hardwired units  
- Test regularly  

Detectors should not be considered a substitute for proper generator placement but rather a secondary safeguard.

---

## Why Indoor Use Is Especially Dangerous in Apartments

Apartments increase risk due to:

- Shared walls and ventilation systems  
- Limited outdoor space  
- Proximity to neighbors  

Carbon monoxide can affect multiple units, making indoor generator use not only dangerous but also potentially life-threatening to others.

---

## Safer Alternatives for Indoor Backup Power

If indoor backup power is required, consider:

- Battery-powered power stations  
- Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS)  
- Emergency battery packs  

These options are suitable for:

- Charging phones and laptops  
- Powering routers and lights  
- Supporting small medical devices  

They are not replacements for full-size generators but offer safe indoor functionality.

---

## What to Do During a Power Outage

During an outage:

- Never bring a generator indoors  
- Never operate near open windows or doors  
- Follow manufacturer safety instructions  
- Prioritize ventilation and distance  

Preparation and understanding are critical to safe generator use.

---

## What Makes This Rule Non-Negotiable

Every major safety authority agrees on this point: **portable generators must never be used indoors**.

The risk is not theoretical. It is well-documented, immediate, and preventable.

---

## Final Thoughts

Using a generator indoors is one of the most dangerous mistakes people make during power outages. Carbon monoxide exposure can occur quickly and without warning, even in well-ventilated spaces.

Understanding the risks—and knowing which alternatives are safe—allows you to prepare for outages responsibly. When it comes to generator safety, the safest choice is always the simplest one: keep combustion generators outdoors and use indoor-safe power solutions only where appropriate.
