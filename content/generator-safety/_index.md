## Portable Generator Safety: What You Need to Know

Portable generators are widely used during power outages, emergencies, and outdoor activities. While they provide essential backup power, improper use can lead to **serious injuries, carbon monoxide poisoning, fires, and electrical damage**.

This safety hub brings together all essential generator safety guidance in one place. Whether you are a first-time generator owner or have used one for years, understanding these risks is critical to protecting your home, family, and equipment.

## Why Generator Safety Matters

Portable generators combine three major hazards:

- **Fuel combustion**
- **Electricity**
- **Exhaust gases**

Most generator-related accidents happen not because of equipment failure, but because of **incorrect placement, poor ventilation, overload, or unsafe operating conditions**.

The guides below address the most common and most dangerous scenarios users encounter.

### ⚠️ Carbon Monoxide Risks and Detection

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is the leading cause of portable generator–related deaths.
Because CO is invisible and odorless, many users underestimate how quickly dangerous levels can build up.

This guide explains:

- Why and how generators produce carbon monoxide  
- How CO enters homes  
- Why outdoor placement alone may not be enough  
- Where to place CO detectors  
- Proven ways to reduce CO risks at home  
- What to do if an alarm sounds  
- Early symptoms of CO poisoning

## Common Generator Safety Mistakes

Many serious incidents result from avoidable mistakes, including:

- Running generators indoors or in garages  
- Ignoring carbon monoxide alarms  
- Operating generators in wet conditions without protection  
- Overloading circuits  
- Refueling while the engine is hot  

Understanding and avoiding these mistakes significantly reduces risk.
