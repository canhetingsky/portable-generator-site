## What Is Generator Size?

Generator size refers to the amount of electrical power a generator can deliver, typically measured in **running watts** and **starting (surge) watts**.

- **Running watts** indicate how much power a generator can supply continuously  
- **Starting watts** account for the extra power required when motors and compressors start

Choosing the right generator size helps prevent overloads, protects your appliances, and avoids unnecessary fuel consumption.

## Common Portable Generator Size Ranges

Portable generators are often grouped into size ranges based on wattage. Each range is suitable for different types of use cases.

### 2000–3000 Watt Generators

This size range is ideal for powering essential household appliances during short power outages.

**Common uses include:**

- Refrigerator or freezer
- Lights
- Wi-Fi router
- TV or laptop
- Small kitchen appliances

## How to Choose the Right Generator Size

The most reliable way to choose a generator size is to calculate your total power needs based on the appliances you plan to run.

A generator size calculator helps you:

- Add up running watts accurately
- Account for startup surge requirements
- Avoid oversizing or undersizing your generator

## Common Generator Size Mistakes

Many buyers choose the wrong generator size because they:

- Estimate power needs instead of calculating them
- Ignore startup surge requirements
- Choose a larger generator “just in case” without considering fuel use and noise
- Base decisions on tank size rather than load capacity

Starting with a proper wattage calculation eliminates most of these issues.
