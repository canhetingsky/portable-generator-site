            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Load percentage indicates how much of a generator’s rated wattage is being used at a given time. It is calculated by dividing the actual electrical load in watts by the generator’s rated output and multiplying by 100."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Load percentage is derived from wattage. The same appliance load can represent different load percentages depending on generator size. For example, a 2,000-watt load equals 50% load on a 4,000-watt generator but 25% load on an 8,000-watt generator."

        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Why does generator runtime change with load percentage?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "As load percentage increases, the generator produces more power and consumes fuel at a higher rate. Higher loads shorten runtime per tank, while moderate loads generally allow longer and more efficient operation."
        }

        {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "What load percentage is best for efficient generator operation?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Most portable generators operate most efficiently at moderate loads, typically around 40% to 60% of rated capacity. Extremely low or high loads may reduce efficiency and increase fuel consumption or engine stress."

        {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Should I calculate wattage or load percentage first?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Wattage should be calculated first. Knowing the total wattage of connected appliances allows you to determine load percentage accurately and estimate generator runtime more realistically."
