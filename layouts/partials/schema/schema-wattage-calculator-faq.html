        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This generator wattage calculator estimates the required generator size by adding together the running watts of all selected appliances and then accounting for the single largest starting wattage surge. Because most appliances do not start at the same time, the calculation assumes only one startup surge occurs at once, providing a realistic and practical estimate for portable generator sizing."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why is starting wattage higher than running wattage?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Many appliances require extra power for a short moment when they first start. This initial surge is known as starting wattage and is higher than the power needed to keep the appliance running. Motors, compressors, refrigerators, and power tools commonly have higher starting wattage due to mechanical resistance at startup."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why does the calculator recommend a higher wattage than my total running load?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The recommended generator size includes a safety margin above the calculated load. This extra capacity helps prevent overloading, improves voltage stability, and allows the generator to handle brief power surges more reliably."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Should I choose a generator exactly at the calculated wattage?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It is generally better to choose a generator rated slightly above the calculated wattage. A higher-rated generator provides more stable performance, allows for future appliance additions, and reduces strain during startup surges."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What are the most common portable generator sizes?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Common portable generator sizes range from about 2,000 watts for basic appliances, 3,000 to 4,000 watts for essential household circuits, and 5,000 to 7,500 watts for broader home backup needs."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This calculator provides a practical estimate for typical portable generator use. For whole-home or permanent backup systems, consulting a qualified electrician is recommended."
